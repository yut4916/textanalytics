Python Notes:

Feb 23, 2021
- python is a scripting language
- we put our code into functions so that the user can control when it's run
	- syntax for creating functions:
		def functionName():
- we want to have one main function (?)
- syntax for if statements:
	if (conditional expression):
- white space in python is important (google PEP 8 to learn more)
	- 4 spaces = 1 tab
- dunder = double underscore (ex: __name__)
	- not sure I understand, but it's some sort of specific variable
